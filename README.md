## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: As someone with limited previous experience with Xcode, it was somewhat difficult to initially navigate and understand the UI and the instructions for the pre-work sometimes did not exactly match what I had to do for something to work in the app. Aside from that I was easily able to finish this task.
