**Rave Party** is an app that, as the name suggests, allows the user to initiate a rave party in the app by changing the color of the background. It also display information about the author, the university they attend, and their job aspiration.

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Youtube
   - Comprehensive Search Feature
   - Easy account access
   - Allows users to begin a livestream/upload a video within the app. 
3. Instagram
   - Ability to send posts/reels to Direct Messages
   - Stories Feature
   - Geo-tagging on posts
5. Snapchat
   - Light/Dark Mode
   - Sending a snap to defined groups for ease
   - 1st party and user-created filters

An app I'd like to build is an expense tracker designed for high-school or college students. This app would be similar to existing trackers on the market except it would have features that would be in line with the spending habits of students. Features that I would likely include in this app would be: 
- Ability to link bank/credit card accounts directly to the app to give the user a dashboard of their total spending
- Built-in credit score check/estimate
- Credit limit notifications and the ability to add a custom spending limit
- Tips and general information catered to students like recommended credit cards, savings accounts, etc. and to increase financial literacy in general.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: As someone with limited previous experience with Xcode, it was somewhat difficult to initially navigate and understand the UI and the instructions for the pre-work sometimes did not exactly match what I had to do for something to work in the app. Aside from that I was easily able to finish this task.
